    keywords: ['what is quantum computing', 'quantum computer', 'quantum vs classical'],
    response: `Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in superposition states.

Key differences:
• **Classical bits**: Can be either 0 OR 1
• **Qubits**: Can be both 0 AND 1 simultaneously (superposition)
• **Parallel processing**: One qubit represents 2 states, two qubits represent 4 states, n qubits represent 2^n states

This exponential advantage enables quantum computers to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.`
  },

  {
    keywords: ['qubit', 'what is a qubit', 'quantum bit'],
    response: `A qubit (quantum bit) is the fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit that can only be 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.

**Key properties:**
• **Superposition**: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ where α and β are complex amplitudes
• **Measurement**: Collapses superposition to either |0⟩ or |1⟩ with probabilities |α|² and |β|²
• **Entanglement**: Qubits can be correlated in ways impossible for classical bits

Physical implementations include superconducting circuits, trapped ions, photons, and quantum dots.`
  },

  {
    keywords: ['superposition', 'what is superposition'],
    response: `Superposition is a fundamental quantum mechanical principle where a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. For a qubit, this means it can be in a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states at the same time.

**Mathematical representation:**
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

Where:
• α and β are complex probability amplitudes
• |α|² + |β|² = 1 (normalization)
• Measurement collapses to |0⟩ with probability |α|², or |1⟩ with probability |β|²

This property enables quantum parallelism - n qubits can represent 2^n states simultaneously.`
  },

  {
    keywords: ['entanglement', 'quantum entanglement', 'what is entanglement'],
    response: `Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently. Measuring one particle instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of distance.

**Key aspects:**
• **Non-local correlation**: Changes propagate instantly
• **Bell states**: Maximally entangled two-qubit states
• **Applications**: Quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, quantum computing

Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance," but it's now experimentally verified and forms the basis for quantum communication protocols.`

  {
    keywords: ['measurement', 'quantum measurement', 'collapse'],
    response: `Quantum measurement is the process of extracting classical information from a quantum system. When measured, a quantum state collapses from superposition to a definite classical state.

**Key principles:**
• **Wave function collapse**: Superposition reduces to single eigenstate
• **Probabilistic outcomes**: Results follow quantum probability rules
• **No-cloning theorem**: Quantum states cannot be perfectly copied
• **Observer effect**: Measurement changes the quantum state

This measurement process is fundamental to quantum computing and quantum information theory.`

  },

  {
    keywords: ['hadamard gate', 'hadamard', 'h gate'],
    response: `The Hadamard gate (H) is a fundamental quantum gate that creates superposition. It transforms the computational basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ into equal superpositions.

**Matrix representation:**
H = (1/√2) [1  1]
        [1 -1]

**Action:**
H|0⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)
H|1⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)
